## Setup Guide

<Steps>
<Step title="Prerequisite" number="1">

Before you start, ensure that your Tailwind CSS project is set up and ready to go. If not, please refer to the
[Tailwind CSS Getting Started Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) and once you've completed that, come
back to this guide.

</Step>
<Step title="Install Ark UI" number="2">

The first step is to install [Ark UI](https://ark-ui.com). Ark UI is a headless component library that forms the
foundation for most components. To install Ark UI, execute the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash multi
npm install @ark-ui/react
```

</Step>
<Step number="3" title="Install the Tailwind Plugin">

The next package you will need is `@park-ui/tailwind-plugin`. This package contains all the necessary stylesheets.

```bash
npm install @park-ui/tailwind-plugin
```

After you've installed the presets, you'll need to add it to your Tailwind configuration file:

```jsx
const { parkwindPlugin } = require('@park-ui/tailwind-plugin')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [parkwindPlugin],
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  darkMode: ['class'],
}
```

Make sure to import the css preset. This will add the necessary styles to your project.

```tsx
import '@park-ui/tailwind-plugin/preset.css'
```

</Step>
<Step number="4" title="Path Aliases">

To streamline the integration of code snippets without the need to update import statements, we recommend setting up path aliases. <br />
To implement path aliases, modify your `tsconfig.json` file as follows:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // Your other options...
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "~/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["src", "styled-system"]
}
```

If you are using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), it is necessary to include the `vite-tsconfig-paths` plugin in your config file:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tsconfigPaths({ root: './' })],
})
```
</Step>

<Step number="5" title="Add your first component">

The easiest way to add components to your project is by using the Park UI CLI. Execute the following command to initialize the CLI:

```bash
npx @park-ui/cli init
```

You will be prompted to answer a few questions to configure `park-ui.json`:

```txt
- Which CSS framework do you use?: [Panda / Tailwind]
- Which JavaScript framework do you use?: [React / Solid / Vue]
- What is your import alias for components?: [~/components/ui]
- What is your import alias for utilities?: [~/lib]
- Would you like to write the configuration to park-ui.json?: [Yes / No]
```

Now you can start adding components to your project like shown below:

```bash
npx @park-ui/cli add button
```

To add all components at once, use the `--all` flag:

```bash
npx @park-ui/cli add --all
```

And that's it! Happy Hacking ✌️
